# Ping-Pong

This is a solo programming project for Epicodus that requires a web application which takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

    Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
    Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
    Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"

A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
